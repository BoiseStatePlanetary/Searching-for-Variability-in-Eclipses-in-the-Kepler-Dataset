% 2018 May 22 - From Jackson+ (2013) study of HAT-P-7 - "Welsh et al. (2010) discovered ellipsoidal variations in the Kepler Q1 data, with an amplitude of 37.3 ppm. They also estimated that the planetâ€™s phase curve has an amplitude of 31.9 ppm..." - So EVs and planet's phase curve has comparable amplitudes.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Data Analysis}
\subsection{Data Conditioning}
For each system's light curve, we applied the following steps to condition each quarter's the long-cadence (i.e., 30-min integration times) data:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We subtracted the median value from each quarter's PDCSAP\_FLUX time-series, before dividing through by that same median value.
\item We next applied a median boxcar filter with a window size equal to four orbital periods -- we experimented with window sizes from one up to 15 orbital periods (holding fixed the transit parameters to those reported in \citealt{2013ApJ...771...26F}), fitting the out-of-transit photometric signals described below using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LM) \citep{newville_2014_11813}, including the planet's eclipse and phase curve, and four orbital periods maximized the eclipse depth and minimized the distortion to the phase curve using all available data. To mitigate edge-effect distortions from our boxcar filter, we extended the time-series beyond both ends out a full window length by reflecting the original time-series across its boundary.
\item Finally, we stitched each quarter's conditioned data into one long time-series and subtracted the average value of the planet's eclipse (i.e., we zeroed out the eclipse) because, in principle, only the star's light registers during that phase so it sets the baseline against which to measure the photometric variations. Since our phase curve model allows for an arbitrary offset value, zeroing out the eclipse has no physical significance.
\end{enumerate}
Figure \ref{fig:raw-conditioned-data_Analysis_of_Kepler76b} illustrates a portion of the raw and conditioned time-series for Kepler-76 b. 

\subsection{Modeling}
After applying the above conditioning procedure, we fit a series of photometric models to all the available data. We first analyzed the out-of-transit portion of Kepler-76 b's light curve since those signals (the ellipsoidal variations, the planet's phase curve, and the Doppler beaming signal) are independent of the transit and can, in principle, contribute to the transit portion (although in practice, their effects are negligible). 

We folded all data on the best-fit period reported by \citet{2013ApJ...771...26F} and masked out the transit and eclipse portions of the light curve. We then used the LM algorithm to fit the following model to the data:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta F = F_0 + A_{\rm beam} \sin \left(2 \pi\phi \right) - A_{\rm ellip} \cos \left(2\times2\pi\phi \right) - A_{\rm planet} \cos \big(2\pi \left( \phi - \delta \right)\big),
\label{eqn:BEER_curve}
\end{equation}
where $F_0$ represents a constant baseline; $\phi$ the orbital phase ($\phi = 0$ at mid-transit); the second term the Doppler beaming signal \citep{2003ApJ...588L.117L} and $A_{\rm beam}$ its amplitude; the third term the ellipsoidal variations induced by the planet's tidal gravity \citep{2010ApJ...713L.145W} and $A_{\rm ellip}$ its amplitude; and the fourth term the planet's reflected/thermally emitted phase curve, $A_{\rm beam}$ its amplitude, and $\delta$ an offset in the curve's maximum from superior conjunction at $\phi = 0.5$ \citep{2013ApJ...771...26F}. Each of the amplitudes and the phase offset relate to the physical parameters for the planet (mass, albedo, etc.) as we describe below, but for this step in our analysis, we simply fit the baseline, amplitudes, and offset without regard to their physical significance. 

We next calculated the signal given by Equation \ref{eqn:BEER_curve} and subtracted from the in-transit portion of the light curve, ostensibly removing its (small) influence on the transit. We then used LM to fit a standard transit curve with quadratic limb-darkening \citep{2002ApJ...580L.171M}\footnote{As implemented in PyAstronomy -- \url{https://github.com/sczesla/PyAstronomy}.} to the portion of the time-series within two transit durations of the reported mid-transit time, allowing the out-of-transit baseline to vary -- this analysis netted initial best-fit transit parameters $a/R_\star$ the ratio of the planet's semi-major axis to the stellar radius, $b$ the impact parameter, and the planet-to-star radius ratio $R_{\rm p}/R_\star$. We assumed the orbital eccentricity is equal to zero based on the photometric and radial velocity analyses in \citet{2013ApJ...771...26F} and held fixed the limb-darkening coefficients $\gamma_1 = 0.313$ and $\gamma_2 = 0.304$  \citep{2013ApJ...771...26F}. We explored two other sets of quadratic limb-darkening coefficients, estimated assuming the stellar parameters from \citet{2013ApJ...771...26F} and using the model from \citet{2015MNRAS.450.1879E} but found different values had negligible impact on our transit analysis.

To check for transit-timing variations, we fit each individual transit (the full orbital light curve this time and not just the in-transit portion) using LM again and held fixed all transit parameters except the mid-transit times and out-of-transit baseline. For uncertainties, we took the square root of the diagonal elements of the resulting covariance matrix \citep[p.~790]{Press:2007:NRE:1403886} and confirmed the accuracy of the mid-transit times and uncertainties by also fitting transit curves with a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) analysis \citep{2013PASP..125..306F} to several individual transits -- we achieved convergence with 100 walkers, each a chain of 1,000 links and a burn-in phase of 300 links. Although most single transits are detectable, they usually comprise one or two data points and so provide no useful constraints on parameters other than the mid-transit times. Finally, we fit the collection of mid-transit times with linear and quadratic ephmerides using an MCMC analysis (100 walker chains, 5,000 links in each with a burn-in of 1,500 links) and found no significant departure from the latter. We also found no significant periodicities using a Lomb-Scargle periodogram \citep{1976Ap&SS..39..447L, 1982ApJ...263..835S}. Figure \ref{fig:TTVs_Analysis_of_Kepler76b} shows the resulting transit ephemeris, which is consistent with that reported in \citet{2013ApJ...771...26F}. With this updated ephemeris, we folded together all available data and fit the resulting transit portion of the light curve, with free parameters $a/R_\star$, $b$, $R_{\rm p}/R_\star$, and an estimate of the per-point noise. We used the same MCMC analysis as above, with 100 walker chains, each with 32,000 links and a burn-in phase of 16,000 links. We aimed for convergence by requiring small auto-correlation times \citep[e.g][]{geyer1992} for the mean chain of each fit parameter (none exceeded 250 links) and a Geweke Z-score \citep{Geweke92evaluatingthe} of about 2 or less. Figure \ref{fig:folded-transit-corner-plot_Analysis-of-Kepler76b} shows the resulting parameter distributions, with the best-fit values and uncertainties given in Table X and Figure shows the resulting transit curve and residuals.

, eclipse, and out-of-transit variations using the following model:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta F = T\left(\phi\right) + A_{\rm beam} \sin\left(2\pi\phi\right) - A_{\rm ellip} \cos\left( 2 \times 2\pi\phi \right) + E \bigg( F_{\rm 0} - A_{\rm planet} \cos\left[ 2\pi\left( \phi - \Delta \phi \right) \right] \bigg), \label{eqn:photometric_model}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta F$ is the normalized photometric variation, $\phi$ the orbital phase (0 at mid-transit, 0.5 at mid-eclipse), and $T$ the transit signal (modeled using \citealt{2002ApJ...580L.171M} as implemented in PyAstronomy\footnote{https://github.com/sczesla/PyAstronomy}). In the equation, the second term represents the beaming effect, with $A_{\rm beam}$ as its amplitude, and the third term represents the ellipsoidal variations, with $A_{\rm ellip}$ as its amplitude. The very last term models the planet's phase curve: $F_{\rm 0} - A_{\rm planet}$ represents the minimum in the planet's photometric contribution at $\phi - \Delta \phi = 0$, and $F_{\rm 0} + A_{\rm planet}$ the peak in the phase curve at $\phi - \Delta \phi = 0.5$, with $\Delta \phi$ allowing for a phase offset, which has been reported for some planets (refs). $E$ represents the planet's eclipse signal and takes on whatever fraction of the planet's disk remains unocculted (unity outside of eclipse and zero at mid-eclipse for a completely occulted planet).

the Levenburg-Marquardt to fit a standard transit light curve \citep{2002ApJ...580L.171M} appropriately convolved over the to the mid-transit times for all the transits in each dataset and confirmed they conformed to a linear ephemeris, finding no evidence for transit-timing variations. (Below we report new ephemerides slightly updated relative to previous analyses for each object.) 

\section{Results}

\section{Discussion and Conclusions}
Figure \ref{fig:eclipse_estimates} shows estimates of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) expected for secondary eclipses observed by \tess\ based on the synthetic population of planets in the \tess\ yield calculations from \citet{2018arXiv180405050B}. For each synthetic planet from that study, we estimated the eclipse depth $\Delta$ for the case that the planet reflects all of the light it receives from the star (shown in blue) and for the case that the planet emits (and absorbs) light as a perfect blackbody (shown in orange). For the former case, the eclipse depth is given as $\frac{1}{4} \left( \frac{R_{\rm p}}{a} \right)^2$, where $R_{\rm p}$ is the planetary radius and $a$ is the orbital semi-major axis. We then estimated the corresponding SNR by multiplying the transit SNRs given for each planet by planet-star radius ratio squared and then by $\Delta_{\rm reflected}$. For the latter case, we used the stellar insolation given for each planet and assumed dayside thermal equilibrium with zero albedo for each planet to estimate a brightness temperature and convolved the resulting blackbody curve against the \tess\ spectral response function\footnote{https://tessgi.github.io/TessGiWebsite/the-tess-space-telescope.html}. We combined the insolation and planet's orbital distance to estimate the stellar effective temperature and, likewise, convolved the corresponding blackbody curve against the response function. Finally, we divided the planet's convolved brightness by the star's and used the re-scaled transit SNR to calculate the SNR for the thermally emitted eclipse. Figure \ref{fig:eclipse_estimates} only shows those SNR-values $> 3$, among which the vast majority (54 of 62 total) have $R_{\rm p} \geq 10\ R_{\rm Earth}$.

The synthetic population from \citet{2018arXiv180405050B} included 4,553 planets, and Figure \ref{fig:eclipse_estimates} suggests only about 1\% of these may have secondary eclipses detectable for \tess. However, among those, our calculation suggests that the eclipse signals will be considerably more sensitive to emitted than reflected light, in contrast to the eclipses observed by \kepler\ (ref), which owes largely to the fact that the \tess\ spectral response function is more sensitive at longer wavelengths than that of \kepler. Presumably, this different sensitivity also means detectable \tess\ eclipses will probe atmospheric thermal structures more than \kepler\ eclipses could.
