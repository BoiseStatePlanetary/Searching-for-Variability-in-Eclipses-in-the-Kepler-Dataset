% 2018 May 22 - From Jackson+ (2013) study of HAT-P-7 - "Welsh et al. (2010) discovered ellipsoidal variations in the Kepler Q1 data, with an amplitude of 37.3 ppm. They also estimated that the planetâ€™s phase curve has an amplitude of 31.9 ppm..." - So EVs and planet's phase curve has comparable amplitudes.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Data Analysis}
\subsection{Data Conditioning}
For each system's light curve, we applied the following steps to condition each quarter's the long-cadence (i.e., 30-min integration times) data:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We subtracted the median value from each quarter's PDCSAP\_FLUX time-series, before dividing through by that same median value.
\item We next applied a median boxcar filter with a window size equal to an integer number $n$ of orbital periods for the target -- for each system, we considered $n$ from one up to five, choosing the value that maximizes the eclipse signal when we fold together all the available data on the best-fit orbital period from previous analyses. To mitigate edge-effect distortions, we extended the time-series beyond both ends out a full window length by reflecting the original time-series across its boundary.
\item Finally, we stitched each quarter's conditioned data into one long time-series and subtracted the average value of the planet's eclipse (i.e., we zeroed out the eclipse) because, in principle, only the star's light registers during that phase so it sets the baseline against which to measure the photometric variations. Since our phase curve model allows for an arbitrary offset value, zeroing out the eclipse has no physical significance.
\end{enumerate}
Figure \ref{fig:Analysis_of_Kepler76b_data} illustrates a portion of the raw and conditioned time-series for Kepler-76 b. 

\subsection{Model}

After applying the above conditioning procedure, we folded together all available data on the transit ephemeris from a previous study (each planet's section below gives the corresponding references) and, using a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo analysis \citep{}, we fit the folded transit, eclipse, and out-of-transit variations using the following model:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta F = T\left(\phi\right) + A_{\rm beam} \sin\left(2\pi\phi\right) - A_{\rm ellip} \cos\left( 2 \times 2\pi\phi \right) + E \bigg( F_{\rm 0} - A_{\rm planet} \cos\left[ 2\pi\left( \phi - \Delta \phi \right) \right] \bigg), \label{eqn:photometric_model}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta F$ is the normalized photometric variation, $\phi$ the orbital phase (0 at mid-transit, 0.5 at mid-eclipse), and $T$ the transit signal (modeled using \citealt{} as implemented in PyAstronomy \citealt{}). In the equation, the second term represents the beaming effect, with $A_{\rm beam}$ as its amplitude, and the third term represents the ellipsoidal variations, with $A_{\rm ellip}$ as its amplitude. The very last term models the planet's phase curve: $F_{\rm 0} - A_{\rm planet}$ represents the minimum in the planet's photometric contribution at $\phi - \Delta \phi = 0$, and $F_{\rm 0} + A_{\rm planet}$ the peak in the phase curve at $\phi - \Delta \phi = 0.5$, with $\Delta \phi$ allowing for a phase offset, which has been reported for some planets (refs).

the Levenburg-Marquardt to fit a standard transit light curve \citep{2002ApJ...580L.171M} appropriately convolved over the to the mid-transit times for all the transits in each dataset and confirmed they conformed to a linear ephemeris, finding no evidence for transit-timing variations. (Below we report new ephemerides slightly updated relative to previous analyses for each object.)

\section{Results}

\section{Discussion and Conclusions}
Figure \ref{fig:eclipse_estimates} shows estimates of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) expected for secondary eclipses observed by \tess\ based on the synthetic population of planets in the \tess\ yield calculations from \citet{2018arXiv180405050B}. For each synthetic planet from that study, we estimated the eclipse depth $\Delta$ for the case that the planet reflects all of the light it receives from the star (shown in blue) and for the case that the planet emits (and absorbs) light as a perfect blackbody (shown in orange). For the former case, the eclipse depth is given as $\frac{1}{4} \left( \frac{R_{\rm p}}{a} \right)^2$, where $R_{\rm p}$ is the planetary radius and $a$ is the orbital semi-major axis. We then estimated the corresponding SNR by multiplying the transit SNRs given for each planet by planet-star radius ratio squared and then by $\Delta_{\rm reflected}$. For the latter case, we used the stellar insolation given for each planet and assumed dayside thermal equilibrium with zero albedo for each planet to estimate a brightness temperature and convolved the resulting blackbody curve against the \tess\ spectral response function\footnote{https://tessgi.github.io/TessGiWebsite/the-tess-space-telescope.html}. We combined the insolation and planet's orbital distance to estimate the stellar effective temperature and, likewise, convolved the corresponding blackbody curve against the response function. Finally, we divided the planet's convolved brightness by the star's and used the re-scaled transit SNR to calculate the SNR for the thermally emitted eclipse. Figure \ref{fig:eclipse_estimates} only shows those SNR-values $> 3$, among which the vast majority (54 of 62 total) have $R_{\rm p} \geq 10\ R_{\rm Earth}$.

The synthetic population from \citet{2018arXiv180405050B} included 4,553 planets, and Figure \ref{fig:eclipse_estimates} suggests only about 1\% of these may have secondary eclipses detectable for \tess. However, among those, our calculation suggests that the eclipse signals will be considerably more sensitive to emitted than reflected light, in contrast to the eclipses observed by \kepler\ (ref), which owes largely to the fact that the \tess\ spectral response function is more sensitive at longer wavelengths than that of \kepler. Presumably, this different sensitivity also means detectable \tess\ eclipses will probe atmospheric thermal structures more than \kepler\ eclipses could.
